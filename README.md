# Powershell Profile

A copy of my WindowPowershell directory. Includes a few time-saving aliases.

### Dependencies
* msysgit (Git for windows): [http://git-scm.com/download/win][1] *Assumes default install directory: C:\Program Files(x86)\Git*
* posh-git: [https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git][2]

###Notes
Modify `$devDir`  in *Microsoft.Powershell_profile.ps1* to wherever the posh-git repo lives. Dev folder is used in my case for easy updates.
